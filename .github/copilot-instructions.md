# Copilot instructions for this repository

This repository is a personal learning workspace for Python data-analysis exercises (daily scripts/exercises). The guidance below is focused, actionable, and tailored to the repository layout and conventions discovered in the codebase.

**What this repo is**
- **Small exercise-based project**: top-level scripts named `day1.py` .. `day6.py` (note: there is a file named `day 5.py` with a space). Treat these as learning exercises, not production services.
- **Data examples**: `test_data.py` contains example `pandas` usage and can be used as a runnable smoke test.
- **Dependencies**: pinned in `requirements.txt` (e.g., `pandas`, `numpy`).

**How to run locally (developer workflow examples)**
- **Activate virtualenv**: `source .venv/bin/activate` (the project commonly uses a `.venv` virtual environment).
- **Install deps**: `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
- **Run an exercise script**: `python day6.py` (or `python "day 5.py"` for the file with a space; prefer renaming to remove spaces when editing).
- **Quick data smoke-run**: `python test_data.py` to validate `pandas` usage and printing.

**Project-specific patterns and conventions**
- Files named `day*.py` are incremental tutorial/exercise files; modifications should preserve the pedagogical intent unless the user asks for refactors.
- Expect short, self-contained scripts (no package structure, no CLI framework). Keep edits minimal and idiomatic for beginners.
- The repository uses pinned runtime libs in `requirements.txt`. When adding new code that requires extra packages, add them to `requirements.txt` with a specific version.

**Examples to reference when coding**
- Use `test_data.py` as an example of using `pandas.DataFrame` construction, filtering, sorting, and printing outputs.
- When adding or editing lessons, follow the simple script style: import, small dataset, operations, `print()` results.

**File/formatting gotchas observed**
- `day 5.py` contains a space in the filename. Be careful when invoking or importing it from scripts — wrap the name in quotes when calling from shell or rename it to `day5.py` if making a persistent change.
- `day6.py` currently contains placeholder comment content; expect that some lesson files may be incomplete.

**Safety for automated edits**
- Do not bulk-modify all `day*.py` files. Make focused, small changes and preserve existing examples unless the user requests broad refactoring.
- When adding tests or examples, place them at top-level only if they are small runnable scripts (like `test_data.py`). Prefer adding new exercise files named `dayN.py`.

**Commit / PR tips for the user**
- Keep commits focused per-day/exercise (e.g., "Add solution for day6 while-loop examples").
- If renaming files (e.g., remove space in `day 5.py`), make a single commit that renames and updates any references.

**If you need more context**
- Inspect `README.md` for the project goal (learning Python for data analysis).
- Open `requirements.txt` to see exact versions to use for reproducible runs.

If anything in this file is unclear or you want the tone widened (more prescriptive refactor rules, or stricter CI/test instructions), tell me which areas to expand and I will iterate.
